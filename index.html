                HTML is written in a tree-like structure, where elements have other elements inside of them. When using the developer tools, it is simple to see how the page is structured with boxes inside of boxes. Keeping this structure is very important for readability purposes and for understanding where certain elements will be on the page. 
              </p>
              <p>
                While coding, it is important to not bog down the code with unnecessary repetition. For styling, instead of writing everything inline, it makes a lot more sense for a developer to use CSS to minimize repeated inline style code that would make the HTML more cumbersome and potentially lead to more errors. By using classes and referencing CSS, the developer knows she will get the same style every time.

                Your browser connects to the internet, which uses HTTP to communicate with servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Servers are the same as your computer, except they are optimized for storing information.

              <p> 
                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language of the internet. Markup is what makes the webpage look a certain way. An HTML element contains an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
              </p>
              <p> 
                Computers are stupid because they can only interpret what a human writes for them. That's why we have to ensure that code is written properly. 
              </p>
              <p> 
                There are inline and block tags. Inline tags do not create line breaks. 
              </p>
              <p>
                There are attributes, such as anchors and image sources. An img srouce attribute does not have an end tag and has no content.

                HTML is the structure of the house. CSS is the style choices you make. Javascript is the moving parts. 
              </p>
              <p> 
                HTML is the language that is made up of elements that use tags. CSS is the language that changes how elements look. DOM is the tree structure of the elements. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Adding a class to the opening tag of an element tells the HTML from where to read in the CSS.

              <p> 
                The width of something is the border + padding + content.

                The best way to learn to be a good developer is to code, test, and refine your code. First start by looking for boxes. Second look for repeated styles. Third write the HTML. Fourth apply styles. Fifth fix things

              <p> 
                A computer is a very powerful machine that cannot do anything without instructions. The speed at which a computer can process one cycle is close to light traveling 11 cm. Quite powerful, but not so smart - a computer needs a program, like peanut butter needs jelly. 
              </p>
              <p> 
                A program is a precise set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Based on the program we write, we can basically get the computer to do almost anything we can imagine.  
              </p>
              <p> 
                Programs are written in languages. The language we are going to learn is Python. Computer languages, like speaking languages, have grammar and syntax that makes them work. Unlike speaking languages, they are unambiguous, which ensures that when the program is run, the computer will do exactly what the programmer wants it to do.

            <h2> Python: Variables and Strings </h2>
          </div>
            <div class="lesson_body"> 
              <p> 
                A variable is a name that is used to keep track of a value. The value of the variable can change within a program. Variables make understanding programs easier because they give meaning to numbers, strings or other expressions that other people can follow when they read the code.   
              </p>
              <p> 
                A variable means nothing with assigning a value to it. The way to assign a value to a variable in Python is to use an equals sign. 
                variable_name = expression 
                The expression is what a variable refers to or what is going to replace the variable name in the program. 
                The equals sign in math means equivalency of both sides of the equation while an equals sign for variable assignment means replacement. 
                The right side of the variable assignment always executes first. This is important in order to know whether the value of a variable has changed.   
              </p>
            </div>
          <div class="lesson_title">

              <p> 
                Strings are written by using single or double quotes. Strings can have letters or numbers on the inside. Numbers behave differently than one might expect. For example, print 2+2 and print "2"+"2" will yield different results. 
                print 2+2 --> 4
                print "2"+"2" --> 22
                We can add strings together by using the plus sign as shown above. Here is another example. 
                print "U" + "dacity" --> Udacity
              </p>
              <p>
                Indexing is a way to only print part of a string. This is done using square brackets like this []. You can use a colon within the brackets to get a range. If you leave either side before the colon blank [:], you will go from the beginning to the end.

                <p> 
                  Functions are small blocks of defined reusable code that take an input and create an output.    
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Functions can be saved, which allows the computer to execute them over and over. Functions are great for repetitive tasks.    
                </p>
                <p> 
                  Outputs are what comes out of a function once an input is put in. The most common output with Python is using return.

                <p> 
                  An if statement tells Python to evaluate a block of code while the statement is true. Afterwards the statement will return false. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  While loops are used for funning a procedure many times until the procdure returns false.
