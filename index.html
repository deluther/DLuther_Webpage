            Your browser connects to the internet, which uses HTTP to communicate with servers. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Servers are the same as your computer, except they are optimized for storing information.  
            <p>

            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the language of the internet. Markup is what makes the webpage look a certain way. An HTML element contains an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Computers are stupid because they can only interpret what a human writes for them. That's why we have to ensure that code is written properly. 
          </p>
          <p> 
            There are inline and block tags. Inline tags do not create line breaks. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There are attributes, such as anchors and image sources. An img srouce attribute does not have an end tag and has no content.

            HTML is the structure of the house. CSS is the style choices you make. Javascript is the moving parts. 
         </p>
         <p> 
            HTML is the language that is made up of elements that use tags. CSS is the language that changes how elements look. DOM is the tree structure of the elements. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding a class to the opening tag of an element tells the HTML from where to read in the CSS.

            Every element contains content, padding, border, and margin. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            The width of something is the border + padding + content. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            The best way to learn to be a good developer is to code, test, and refine your code. First start by looking for boxes. Second look for repeated styles. Third write the HTML. Fourth apply styles. Fifth fix things
